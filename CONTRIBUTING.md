## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.


## [Git Commit Messages][website_git_commit_messages]

Commit messages are a _hugely_ important part of working with git.
They not only help other workers to understand your changes quickly, they also are the basement for new releases and their release notes.
Thus, you really should account these following rules [cited from here][website_git_commit_messages] in your commits.

First of all, commits should be `atomic`.
One commit should contain only changes of a few lines of code (or one single feature).
This method seems to be too verbose and kind of annoying, but when working with Git logs (`git log`) or GitHub's network tree, this is a huge advantage.
Branch management, releases and especially finding bugs is way easier with small commit messages.

Some points about the commit message style:
* Separate `subject` from `body` with a blank line.
  The body explains _what_ has changed and _why_, not _how_ it has changed.
  _How_ can be checked by looking at the commit changes itself.
* Line widths
    * 1st line (`subject`) up to 50 characters
    * 2nd line empty
    * Remaining (`body`) lines up to 72 characters
* Capitalize the `subject` line
  ```diff
  - fix typo ...
  + Fix typo ...
  ```
* Do not end the `subject` line with a period
  ```diff
  - Refactor brackets of some if-statements.
  + Refactor brackets of some if-statements
  ```
* Use the present tense  
  ```diff
  - Added feature
  + Add feature
  ```
* Use the imperative mood, no other language styles (no description either)  
  ```diff
  - Moves cursor to ...
  - Fixed bug ...
  - Sweet new API methods ...
  + Move cursor to ...
  + Fix bug ...
  + Add new API methods for ...
  ```
In summary, a properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:  
  `If applied, this commit will <your subject line>`

Consider using following verbs/flags in your commit messages:
* `fix` when the commit contains bug fixes
* `doc(s)` when writing documentation
* `test(s)` when tests were changed/added
* `style` when code or format style changes occur in the commit
* `refactor` when changes __DO NOT__ change functionality


## [Gitflow Workflow][website_gitflow_workflow]

This project uses [Gitflow Workflow][website_gitflow_workflow], a nice and clear way to work effectively.

This means we are using the following branches:
* `master`: the official release (using tags)
* `develop`: branch for active development
* `release/<tag>`: temporary branch off `develop` for bug fixes and docs before getting merged into `master`
* `feature/<name>`: branches for specific feature development
* `hotfix/<name>`: branches for bug fixes branched off `master`
* `fix/<name>`: branches for bug fixes branched off `develop`


## Releases

You can copy and use the following template for new releases.
In general, needed information should be optained from commit messages.
```
## Downloads

[Download for Windows](download_link_windows)
[Download as App for macOS](download_link_macOS)
[Download as executable jar](download_link_jar)
Download for Linux and others: see below

### Release Checklist

Please check the following points for a new release.
* Is the distribution and release version correct in [build.gradle](build.gradle) files?
* Are all tests passing?
* Has `release` been merged into `master`?
* Is a new teaser picture needed/recommended?
* Are all distribution files added?
    * `./gradlew :microtrafficsim-ui:distAll` creates the distribution files, which then can be found in `microtrafficsim-ui/build/distributions`.
    * the `executable jar file` can be found in `microtrafficsim-ui/build/libs`
    * It can help to call `./gradlew clean` before executing the build and dist commands.


### [Semantic Versioning][website_semantic_versioning]

"Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:
* `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API changes,
* `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* `PATCH` version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labesl for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`."

For more information, see [the original site][website_semantic_versioning].


### Release for macOS

In case you are releasing for macOS, the current version of this simulation is only working with Java 8 (tested with `1.8.0_172`).
For correct building, the following code lines should be set
```gradle
bundleJRE = true
jreHome = "${System.env.JAVA_HOME}"
```
in `microtrafficsim-ui/build.gradle`.
Hence you have to set your `JAVA_HOME` to a correct `JDK`.
This setup is tested with `macOS 10.13.4`.
If you don't do this, the main-ui could probably start but bugs like deadlock behaviour when loading a new map may occur.
Setting `bundleJRE = false` follows into errors when multiple `JDKs` are installed.
To make the life of end users easier, just bundle the `JRE` as described above.


## Java

The following conventions and suggestions should be followed.
They help a lot keeping overview and the code clear.
These conventions just extend common Java style, meaning for instance that `camelCase` is used though it is not mentioned below.


### File Style

* Header files should __NOT__ contain redundant information (like date, license).
  Authors and credits are accepted.
  This is not only to prevent copying code without its authors, it also helps to find a person who (hopefully) understands the code.

  _For instance date and license are stored through your VCS (`git`) or repo.
  Writing this information in the header would cause confusion about its reliability._

  ```Java
  package xyz;

  import java.*;  // :)

  /**
   * Class explanations are going -here-.
   *
   * @author Maximilian Luz
   * @author Dominic Parga Cacheiro
   */
  public class Foo {
      // content
  }
  ```

* Maximum line width is `100`.

  _This is a good trade off between `120` and `80`.
  Humans have trouble reading the code with increasing line width.
  In general, more than `80` is not recommended, but Java is a very verbose language._

* Use `4 spaces` for indention (p.s.: [could help your salary](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs)!).


### Coding Conventions

* Use `constants` over `magic numbers`!

  _Even you as the author will not know the meaning of every number after several months.
  And if you know, you will probably forget the precision of your constant and the places, where you put them (-> bad for debugging)._

  ```java
  // BAD

  float area = 3.1 * radius * radius;
  // (...)
  // somewhere else in the code
  float circum = 2 * 3.1415 * radius;
  // or
  float circum = 6.283 * radius;



  // GOOD

  public static final float PI   = 3.1415;
  public static final float PI_2 = 6.2832;

  float area = PI * radius * radius;
  // (...)
  // somewhere else in the code
  float circum = 2 * PI * radius;
  // or
  float circum = PI_2 * radius;
  ```

* Make __visibility as closest__ as possible.

  _Usually, you tend to not bother with visibility, but visibility helps a lot with getting nice and persistent interfaces._

* __Use `getter`/`setter`__ instead of direct access, even for private usage.

  _This is unhandy in Java, but important for maintenance.
  Changing the implementation of a class should tend to make no difference for users of this class.
  Furthermore, debugging with breakpoints is much more easier when you only have to make one breakpoint instead of many at different positions.
  Same argument counts for synchronization code snippets.
  [The code is getting inlined](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23931546/java-getter-and-setter-faster-than-direct-access)._

  `getter` starts with `get`, `setter` starts with `set`.
  Those `getter` returning a boolean expression may start differently, but with a verb.
  Corresponding fields are named like adjectives/states.
  Field names adapt to their corresponding `getter`/`setter`, not the other way around.
  ```diff
  - count()
  + getCount()

  - boolean isRunning = false;
  + boolean running = true;
  + boolean isRunning() { return running; }
  ```

* Use __white spaces around binary operators__.
  Exceptions can be made for special cases to improve readability (see below).

  ```diff
  - int e = (- a) * b;
  + int e = (-a) * b;

  - int e = a*b;
  + int e = a * b;

  + int e = a * b + c * d;    // ok, but not recommended here
  + int e = a*b + c*d;        // improves readability
  ```

* Use control structures with `curly brackets` and the keyword `else` after the closing bracket for nice commenting.

  _Using control structures without `curly brackets` are easy to write, but usually very uncomfortable to read (especially inside other control structures).
  Most of the time code is read, not written, so `curly brackets` should be used._

  ```java
  // BAD
  // may confuse

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
          // Are these comment lines ignored?
          // Can't remember without my IDE...
          if (isRunning)
              doSomething();
          else
              doSomethingElse();
          doAnything(); // NOT in the loop, but seems to be due to wrong indention



  // GOOD
  // clear and easy to read

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
          // no problem with comments
          if (isRunning) {
              doSomething();
          }
          // `else` after closing bracket for nice commenting
          else {
              doSomethingElse();
          }
      }
  }
  doAnything();
  ```


### Documentation

* Separate class sections with `/*****/` (whole line).
  Take the following code snippet for inspiration.
  ```java
  public class Vehicle {
    private Color color;

  /********************************************************/
    // group 0, e.g. constructors and factory methods

    public Vehicle(Color color) {
      this.color = color;
    }

    public static Vehicle getRedVehicle() {
      return new Vehicle(Color.RED);
    }

  /********************************************************/
    // group 1, e.g. getter/setter

    public Color getColor() {
      return color;
    }

    public void setColor(Color color) {
      this.color = color;
    }

  /********************************************************/
    // group 2, e.g. Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model

    public void accelerate() {
      // ...
    }

    public void brake() {
      // ...
    }

    public void dawdle() {
      // ...
    }

    public void move() {
      // ...
    }

  /********************************************************/
    // group 3 (e.g. private classes)
  }
  ```

* Use annotations and html only where expected and helpful.
  Some useful ones:

  `@author Dominic Parga Cacheiro`  
  declares "Dominic Parga Cacheiro" as author of the class.
  In case of multiple authors, every author gets its own `@author`-tag.
  This tag should be seen as credit.
  See [File Style](#file-style) for more information.

  `@Override`  
  indicates that the annotated method is inherited from the parent class.

  `{@code xyz}`  
  can be used in JavaDocs to format text into code (with literals of the same width).

  `{@literal xyz}`  
  can be used in JavaDocs to use the literals as they are, not interpreted (e.g. as html).

  `<p>...</p>`  
  wraps a paragraph for formatting purpose, for instance it adds empty lines between paragraphs.
  This should be used over `<br>`.

  `<ul>`  
  `<li>` some item  
  `<li>` some other item  
  `</ul>`  
  adds an enumeration.
  This should be used over `&bull;`.

  `&bull;`  
  is a Point (similar to an enumeration item), but not a replacement for enumeration (see `<ul>` above).
  Can be used for dividing text snippets.

  `<br>`  
  is a line break, but it should be avoided and `<p>...</p>` should be used instead.
  Besides "dirty style" another reason is: some IDEs does not parse this linebreak in its JavaDoc preview.

  ```java
  /**
   * <p>
   * This is the JavaDoc of the following method.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>
   * With {@literal <p>} you start a new paragraph.
   * Possible values for parameter x are:
   * <ul>
   * <li> {@code < 3} e.g. {@code x == 2}
   * <li> {@code >= 3} e.g. {@code x == 3}
   * </ul>
   * </p>
   */
  public void doStuff(int x) {
      if (x < 3) {
          System.out.println("x < 3");
      }
      else {
          System.out.println("x >= 3");
      }
  }
  ```

* A file `package-info.java` in a package can be used for package documentation.

  com/foo/package-info.java:
  ```java
  /**
   * package documentation
   */
  package com.foo;
  ```

### Project Conventions

* Prefer package/folder/file management over class mangement if `meaningful`.  
  __BUT:__ Think in an intuitive, handy and `deterministic`(!) way and don't take structuring and subfolding too far.

  Always ask yourself:  
  `How would most of the people search for this class?`  
  Someone without knowing your whole project structure should be able to find a file at the first try.  
  `In every folder, there should be only one option to continue searching (-> determinism).`

  _Take a math API for instance.
  It is okay to put basic classes like vector and matrix classes in __ONE__ package called `math`, because that's what it is.
  Someone searching for these classes will find them easily in this package even if there are a lot more classes in it.
  Think of creating a subfolder for your matrices and another subfolder for graph data structures.
  Is a matrix describing graph structures belonging to the matrix or the graph folder?
  It would be annoying to look for such a file in such a folder structure due to non-intuitive subfoldering._


## Python

The following conventions and suggestions should be followed.
They help a lot keeping overview and the code clear.

Keep [`The Zen of Python`][website_wikipedia_zen_of_python] in mind when coding python.
From [Wikipedia - Python][website_wikipedia_python]:  
In general, the language's core philosophy (...) includes
```
Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Readability counts.
```
which you may call `pythonic`.


### File Style

* Header files should __NOT__ contain redundant information (like date, license).
  Authors and credits are accepted.
  This is not only to prevent copying code without its authors, it also helps to find a person who (hopefully) understands the code.

  _For instance date and license are stored through your VCS (`git`) or repo.
  Writing this information in the header would cause confusion about its reliability._

  ```python
  '''
  This is an example for a python file.
  The header should explain this file/module.

  Important:
  (1) Empty lines are on purpose.
  (2) Sort imports in alphabetical order.
  '''
  __author__ = 'Maximilian Luz, Dominic Parga Cacheiro'
  __credits__ = 'Maximilian Luz, Dominic Parga Cacheiro, Jan-Oliver Schmidt'

  # first: built-in imports
  import argparse

  # then: third-party-modules
  import matplotlib

  # last: own modules
  import my_module


  # content
  ```

* Maximum line width is `80`.

  _Humans have trouble reading the code with increasing line width.
  In general, more than `80` is not recommended.
  Since python is not such a verbose language, you should stick with this._

* Use `4 spaces` for indention (p.s.: [could help your salary](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/06/15/developers-use-spaces-make-money-use-tabs)!).


### Coding Conventions

* Class names are written in `CamelCase`, functions, fields in `snake_case`.

  In python, more or less every field in a file can be accessed __from any file__.
  Hence, you should mark "private" fields with a single underscore before its name.
  ```python
  class SuperCircle:

      def __init__(self, super_radius):
          # BAD
          self._super_radius = super_radius

          # GOOD
          self._super_radius = super_radius
  ```
  They still can be accessed from outside the class, but shouldn't.
  For more information about the underscore (especially dunderscore) in python, we highly recommend you reading [this pretty site][website_python_underscore].

* Use `constants` over `magic numbers`!

  _Even you as the author will not know the meaning of every number after several months.
  And if you know, you will probably forget the precision of your constant and the places, where you put them (-> bad for debugging)._

  ```python
  # BAD

  area = 3.1 * radius * radius;
  # (...)
  # somewhere else in the code
  circum = 2 * 3.1415 * radius;
  # or
  circum = 6.283 * radius;



  # GOOD

  # maybe inside a wrapper class?
  PI   = 3.1415;
  PI_2 = 6.2832;

  area = PI * radius * radius;
  # (...)
  # somewhere else in the code
  circum = 2 * PI * radius;
  # or
  circum = PI_2 * radius;
  ```

* Use `'` for strings, not `"`, because it looks cleaner.

  ```python
  def do_stuff():
    '''
    Some python doc
    '''
    x = 42

  def do_more_stuff():
    """
    More text, but its marks are looking kind of fuzzy
    """
    x = 24
    ```


* Make __visibility as closest__ as possible.

  _Usually, you tend to not bother with visibility, but visibility helps a lot with getting nice and persistent interfaces._

* __Use `getter`/`setter`__ instead of direct access.

  _This is important for maintenance.
  Changing the implementation of a class should tend to make no difference for users of this class.
  Furthermore, debugging with breakpoints is much more easier when you only have to make one breakpoint instead of many at different positions.
  Same argument counts for synchronization code snippets._

  Python supports this issue a lot by the keyword `@property` in combination with `@<field_name>.setter`.
  ```python
  class Length:

      def __init__(self, metres):
          self._metres = metres

      @property
      def metres(self):
          return self._metres

      @property
      def kilometres(self):
          return self._metres / 1000.0

      @kilometres.setter
      def kilometres(self, kilometres):
          self._metres = 1000.0 * kilometres


  # access
  length = Length(42.0)
  print(length.metres)        # prints 42.0
  print(length.kilometres)    # prints 0.042

  # set properties
  length.kilometres = 0.043   # allowed
  length.metres = 43.0        # no setter -> error
  ```
  It's very handy to use this, but keep in mind that these properties will be used for quick access.
  Thus, they should not be seen as replacement for a function calculating a lot.

* Use __white spaces around binary operators__.
  Exceptions can be made for special cases to improve readability (see below).

  ```diff
  - e = (- a) * b;
  + e = (-a) * b;

  - e = a*b;
  + e = a * b;

  + e = a * b + c * d;    # ok, but not recommended here
  + e = a*b + c*d;        # improves readability
  ```


### Documentation

* Separate module sections with `#######` (whole line).
  Take the following code snippet for inspiration.
  ```python
  '''
  <Header>
  '''

  ##########################################################
  # group 0, e.g. imports

  import numpy as np

  ##########################################################

  class Vehicle:

      def __init__(self, color):
          self._color = color

      ######################################################
      # group, e.g. some properties

      @property
      def color(self):
          return self._color

      @color.setter
      def color(self, color):
          self._color = color

      ######################################################
      # group, e.g. Nagel-Schreckenberg-Model

      def accelerate(self):
        # ...

      def brake(self):
        # ...

      def dawdle(self):
        # ...

      def move(self):
        # ...

  ##########################################################
    # group (e.g. static functions or main-method)
  ```


### Project Conventions

* All executable subprojects should be callable using gradle for easier, unified execution.
  Keep the following folder structure:
  ```
  subproject
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.gradle
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
  ```

* The `main.py` should use
  ```python
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      main() # or similar
  ```
  to execute the script, so importing the script does not execute it.

* The typical way of writing a `python module` is writing a file.
  This follows in less packages as in other languages (like Java).
  Prefer package/folder/file management over class mangement if `meaningful`.  
  __BUT:__ Think in an intuitive, handy and `deterministic`(!) way and don't take structuring and subfolding too far.

  Always ask yourself:  
  `How would most of the people search for this module/class/file?`  
  Someone without knowing your whole project structure should be able to find a file at the first try.  
  `In every folder, there should be only one option to continue searching (-> determinism).`
